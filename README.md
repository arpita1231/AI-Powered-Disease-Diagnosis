# AI-Powered-Disease-Diagnosis
This project aims to create an Al powered system that can help in diagnosing diseases more quickly and accurately. The system works by studying data from patients, which may include symptoms, medical reports, and test results. Using this information, the Al learns to recognize patterns that are linked to different diseases.
